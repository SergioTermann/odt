\section{Introduction}

Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as critical assets in modern aerospace applications, ranging from civilian surveillance and cargo delivery to complex military operations and aerial combat scenarios. The development of intelligent UAV control systems capable of autonomous navigation, strategic decision-making, and adaptive maneuvering in dynamic environments represents one of the most challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence and robotics. Traditional control approaches, while effective in structured environments, often struggle with the inherent complexity, uncertainty, and real-time constraints characteristic of aerial combat and complex navigation scenarios.

Recent advances in transformer-based architectures, particularly Decision Transformers, have shown remarkable promise in sequential decision-making tasks by treating reinforcement learning as a sequence modeling problem. However, existing approaches face significant limitations when applied to UAV control: (1) lack of causal understanding of flight dynamics and environmental interactions, (2) inefficient trajectory representation that fails to capture hierarchical flight patterns, (3) poor handling of uncertainty in dynamic aerial environments, and (4) limited interpretability in critical decision-making scenarios where understanding the reasoning process is essential for safety and reliability.

The integration of causal inference with decision transformers presents a compelling solution to these challenges. Causal reasoning enables the model to understand the underlying cause-and-effect relationships in flight dynamics, environmental interactions, and strategic decision-making processes. This understanding is crucial for UAVs operating in adversarial environments where counterfactual reasoning—the ability to reason about "what would have happened if a different action was taken"—can mean the difference between mission success and failure.

Furthermore, the complexity of UAV flight trajectories necessitates sophisticated abstraction mechanisms that can compress high-dimensional flight paths while preserving critical navigation and tactical information. Traditional trajectory optimization approaches often treat each flight path independently, missing opportunities to leverage hierarchical patterns and causal relationships that exist across different flight scenarios and abstraction levels.

This paper introduces Causal-Guided Hierarchical Trajectory Abstraction for UAV Decision Transformers, a novel framework that addresses these fundamental challenges through the integration of multi-level causal inference with adaptive trajectory optimization. Our approach makes four key contributions to the field of autonomous UAV control:

\textbf{First}, we develop hierarchical causal graph networks that capture multi-level dependencies in flight dynamics, enabling the model to understand causal relationships at different temporal and spatial scales—from immediate control responses to long-term strategic outcomes.

\textbf{Second}, we introduce uncertainty-aware counterfactual decision modules that provide robust trajectory planning under environmental uncertainties, allowing UAVs to make informed decisions even when facing incomplete or noisy sensor information.

\textbf{Third}, we propose adaptive causal discovery algorithms that dynamically learn flight behavior patterns, enabling the system to adapt to new environments and mission requirements without extensive retraining.

\textbf{Fourth}, we design intelligent trajectory abstraction mechanisms that compress and optimize flight paths while preserving critical navigation information, significantly improving computational efficiency and enabling real-time decision-making in resource-constrained UAV platforms.

The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments in the gym\_dogfight environment, a sophisticated aerial combat simulation that provides realistic flight dynamics and adversarial scenarios. Our results show significant improvements in sample efficiency (+27.5\%), decision stability, and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. The framework exhibits particular strength in complex aerial combat scenarios, achieving superior performance in trajectory optimization, collision avoidance, and strategic maneuvering tasks.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents preliminary concepts including counterfactual inference, Section 3 provides an overview of our causal inference innovations, Section 4 details the multi-level causal graph networks, Section 5 describes the enhanced counterfactual decision modules, Section 6 presents the adaptive causal discovery algorithms, and Section 7 discusses experimental results and validation in UAV control scenarios.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Hierarchical Decision Transformer Architecture}

Our framework builds upon the Decision Transformer architecture, extending it with a novel dual-head design specifically tailored for UAV aerial combat scenarios. The core architecture consists of a GPT-2 based transformer backbone that processes sequential state-action-reward trajectories, enhanced with two specialized prediction heads and integrated causal reasoning modules.

\textbf{Dual-Head Architecture}: The system employs two complementary prediction heads:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Task Selection Head}: Predicts discrete high-level tactical decisions from a set of $K=5$ predefined maneuvers (e.g., aggressive pursuit, defensive evasion, missile engagement, terrain following, strategic positioning).
    \item \textbf{Action Parameter Head}: Generates continuous control parameters for aircraft dynamics, specifically 3-dimensional control inputs for pitch, roll, and yaw within the normalized range $[-1, 1]^3$.
\end{itemize}

The mathematical formulation of our dual-head prediction is:
\begin{align}
\text{Task Logits: } &\quad \mathbf{t}_i = f_{\text{task}}(\mathbf{h}_i) \in \mathbb{R}^K \\
\text{Action Parameters: } &\quad \mathbf{a}_i = f_{\text{action}}(\mathbf{h}_i) \in [-1,1]^3
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{h}_i$ represents the hidden state from the transformer backbone at timestep $i$.

\subsection{Causal Graph Networks for UAV Control}

Our causal graph network models relationships between tactical decisions across multiple temporal and abstraction levels, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interdependencies in aerial combat scenarios. The system maintains causal adjacency matrices $\mathbf{A}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K}$ for different levels $l$, where $A^{(l)}_{ij}$ represents the causal strength between task $i$ and task $j$ at level $l$. This multi-level approach enables the system to capture both immediate tactical responses and long-term strategic patterns that emerge during combat engagements.

To capture the temporal nature of aerial combat, we model time-delayed causal effects through temporal causal matrices $\mathbf{T}^{(\tau)} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K}$ for different time lags $\tau$. This temporal modeling is crucial for understanding how current tactical decisions influence future combat scenarios, as the effects of maneuvers like aggressive pursuit or defensive evasion often manifest over multiple time steps. The temporal dependencies allow the system to anticipate the consequences of tactical choices and make more informed decisions based on the expected future state of the engagement.

The final causal-enhanced task prediction combines multi-level and temporal information through a weighted integration mechanism:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{t}_{\text{causal}} = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \alpha_l \mathbf{A}^{(l)} \mathbf{t}_{\text{base}} + \sum_{\tau=1}^{T} \beta_\tau \mathbf{T}^{(\tau)} \mathbf{t}_{\text{history}}^{(\tau)}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_l$ and $\beta_\tau$ are learned attention weights that dynamically adjust the importance of different causal levels and temporal lags, and $\mathbf{t}_{\text{history}}^{(\tau)}$ represents historical task predictions at lag $\tau$. This integration allows the system to leverage both hierarchical causal structures and temporal dependencies to make more robust and contextually appropriate tactical decisions.

\subsection{Counterfactual Inference}

Counterfactual inference addresses the fundamental question "What would have happened if things were different?" This type of reasoning is essential for understanding causal relationships and making robust decisions under uncertainty. Counterfactual reasoning operates at the highest level of Pearl's causal hierarchy, requiring knowledge of the underlying causal structure to answer hypothetical questions about alternative scenarios.

Counterfactual queries are formally expressed as conditional probabilities of the form $P(Y_{x'} = y | X = x, Y = y')$, where $Y_{x'}$ represents the counterfactual outcome that would have occurred under intervention $x'$, given that we observed $X = x$ and $Y = y'$ in the actual world. This mathematical framework allows us to quantify the likelihood of different outcomes under hypothetical conditions.

The process of counterfactual inference follows a systematic three-step approach. First, in the abduction step, we update our beliefs about unobserved variables based on the observed evidence, essentially working backwards from the observed outcomes to infer the likely values of hidden factors. Second, during the action step, we modify the causal model by implementing the counterfactual intervention, changing the causal mechanisms to reflect the hypothetical scenario we wish to explore. Finally, in the prediction step, we compute the probability distribution of outcomes in this modified model, determining what would likely happen under the counterfactual conditions.

To perform counterfactual inference effectively, we require a complete structural causal model consisting of three key components: a causal graph $\mathcal{G}$ that represents the causal structure among variables, structural equations $f_i$ for each variable $X_i$ that specify how each variable is determined by its causes, and knowledge of the distribution of exogenous variables $U$ that capture unobserved factors. The structural causal model is formally defined as:
\begin{equation}
X_i = f_i(\text{Pa}(X_i), U_i), \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, n
\end{equation}
where $\text{Pa}(X_i)$ denotes the parents of $X_i$ in the causal graph, representing the direct causal influences on variable $X_i$.

\subsection{Gym Dogfight Environment Specifications}

\textbf{State Space}: The aerial combat environment provides a 13-dimensional continuous state space including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Position differences between ally and opponent aircraft (3D)
    \item Ally aircraft Euler angles (pitch, roll, yaw)
    \item Ally and opponent heading vectors
    \item Target angle information for missile engagement
    \item Aircraft altitude and target lock status
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Action Space}: The control interface consists of a 3-dimensional continuous action space $\mathcal{A} = [-1,1]^3$ representing normalized control inputs for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pitch control: $a_{\text{pitch}} \in [-1,1]$
    \item Roll control: $a_{\text{roll}} \in [-1,1]$  
    \item Yaw control: $a_{\text{yaw}} \in [-1,1]$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Combat Dynamics}: The environment simulates realistic aerial combat scenarios with missile engagement capabilities, target locking mechanisms, and physics-based flight dynamics through the Harfang3D engine integration.

\subsection{Multi-Stage Causal Training Framework}

Our training methodology employs a three-stage adaptive approach that progressively refines causal understanding:

\textbf{Exploration Stage}: Initial phase focusing on discovering causal relationships with high sparsity regularization ($\lambda_{\text{sparsity}} = 0.1$) and consistency constraints ($\lambda_{\text{consistency}} = 0.05$).

\textbf{Refinement Stage}: Intermediate phase that balances exploration and exploitation by adjusting regularization weights and introducing counterfactual diversity objectives.

\textbf{Exploitation Stage}: Final phase emphasizing stable causal relationships and optimal policy performance with reduced exploration noise.

The training process dynamically adjusts hyperparameters including causal weights, intervention steps, and discovery algorithms (e.g., NOTEARS) based on the current training stage, enabling efficient learning of complex causal structures in aerial combat scenarios.

\section{Methodology}

This section presents our methodology for integrating causal inference with decision transformers in UAV aerial combat systems. Our approach is built upon the actual implementation of a dual-head Decision Transformer enhanced with causal graph networks and counterfactual reasoning modules, specifically designed for the gym\_dogfight environment.

\subsection{System Architecture Overview}

Our framework represents a significant advancement over traditional Decision Transformer architectures by incorporating sophisticated causal reasoning capabilities specifically tailored for UAV aerial combat scenarios. The system architecture is built upon a foundation of three deeply integrated components that work synergistically to enable robust, interpretable, and adaptive decision-making in complex aerial environments.

The core of our system is a dual-head Decision Transformer that extends the standard GPT-2 based transformer backbone with specialized prediction capabilities. This architecture addresses the unique challenges of aerial combat by separating high-level tactical reasoning from low-level control parameter generation. The transformer backbone processes sequential state-action-reward trajectories using multi-head self-attention mechanisms, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies in flight patterns and combat sequences. The hidden representations generated by this backbone serve as the foundation for both tactical decision-making and precise aircraft control.

The first prediction head, the Task Selection Head, operates at the strategic level by predicting discrete tactical maneuvers from a carefully designed set of four fundamental combat tasks: climb, dive, turn, and track. These tasks represent the core maneuvers in aerial combat scenarios and are derived from extensive analysis of expert pilot behavior and combat tactics. The head employs a multi-layer perceptron with softmax activation to generate probability distributions over these tactical choices, allowing the system to express uncertainty in its strategic decisions and enabling more robust planning under ambiguous conditions.

The second prediction head, the Action Parameter Head, focuses on the precise execution of tactical decisions by generating continuous three-dimensional control parameters for aircraft dynamics. These parameters directly control the pitch, roll, and yaw movements of the aircraft within the normalized range of [-1,1]³, ensuring compatibility with the gym_dogfight environment's control interface. The head uses tanh activation to enforce these bounds while maintaining smooth control transitions that are essential for stable flight dynamics.

The mathematical formulation of our dual-head prediction captures this hierarchical decision-making process:
\begin{align}
\text{Task Logits: } &\quad \mathbf{t}_i = f_{\text{task}}(\mathbf{h}_i) \in \mathbb{R}^K \\
\text{Action Parameters: } &\quad \mathbf{a}_i = f_{\text{action}}(\mathbf{h}_i) \in [-1,1]^3
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{h}_i$ represents the rich hidden state from the transformer backbone at timestep $i$, encoding both historical context and current situational awareness.

The second major component is our multi-level Causal Graph Networks, which provide the system with the ability to understand and reason about cause-and-effect relationships in aerial combat scenarios. This component goes beyond simple correlation-based learning by explicitly modeling how different tactical decisions influence each other across multiple temporal and abstraction levels. The causal networks capture both immediate tactical responses and long-term strategic patterns, enabling the system to anticipate the consequences of its actions and make more informed decisions based on causal understanding rather than purely statistical associations.

The third component, the Counterfactual Decision Module, represents our most innovative contribution to UAV decision-making systems. This module addresses the fundamental challenge of reasoning about alternative scenarios and "what-if" questions that are crucial for robust decision-making in adversarial environments. The module incorporates uncertainty quantification mechanisms that allow the system to assess the reliability of its predictions and adjust its decision-making strategy accordingly. This capability is particularly important in aerial combat scenarios where environmental conditions, opponent behavior, and sensor reliability can vary significantly.

The complete system architecture integrates these components through a unified computational framework:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M} = (\mathrm{DT},\, \mathrm{CG},\, \mathrm{CDM})
\end{equation}

where each component is implemented as a specialized PyTorch module within the overall architecture. The integration is achieved through shared hidden representations and joint training objectives that ensure all components work together harmoniously. The system employs gradient-based optimization with carefully designed loss functions that balance the objectives of accurate prediction, causal consistency, and counterfactual reasoning quality.

This architectural design enables our system to operate effectively across different phases of aerial combat, from initial engagement and tactical maneuvering to complex multi-agent scenarios involving multiple aircraft and dynamic environmental conditions. The modular design also facilitates extensibility and adaptation to new combat scenarios or different types of aerial vehicles, making it a versatile platform for autonomous UAV control research and applications.

\subsection{Multi-Level Causal Graph Networks}

Our causal graph network implementation represents a sophisticated approach to modeling the complex interdependencies that characterize UAV aerial combat scenarios. The CausalGraph module is designed to capture both the hierarchical nature of tactical decision-making and the temporal dynamics that govern how combat maneuvers influence each other over time. This multi-faceted approach enables the system to develop a deep understanding of cause-and-effect relationships that extend far beyond simple reactive behaviors.

The foundation of our causal modeling approach lies in a hierarchical causal structure that organizes causal relationships across three distinct temporal scales, each capturing different aspects of aerial combat dynamics. The first level focuses on immediate tactical responses that occur within 1-5 timesteps, capturing the direct causal effects of rapid maneuvers such as evasive actions or immediate counter-attacks. These short-term causal relationships are crucial for understanding how pilots and autonomous systems respond to immediate threats or opportunities in the combat environment.

The second level extends the temporal horizon to capture short-term tactical sequences spanning 5-20 timesteps, which correspond to more complex maneuver combinations and tactical patterns. This level is particularly important for understanding how sequences of actions work together to achieve tactical objectives, such as how a climbing maneuver might be followed by a diving attack or how defensive turns can be chained together to evade multiple threats. The causal relationships at this level help the system understand the strategic coherence of tactical sequences.

The third and highest level captures long-term strategic patterns that emerge over 20 or more timesteps, representing the overarching strategic considerations that guide extended combat engagements. These long-term causal relationships are essential for understanding how individual tactical decisions contribute to overall mission success and how strategic positioning and resource management influence the outcome of prolonged combat scenarios.

Each hierarchical level maintains a dedicated causal adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K}$ where $K=4$ represents the four fundamental combat tasks: climb, dive, turn, and track. These matrices are implemented as learnable parameters initialized to zero, allowing the system to discover causal relationships through the training process:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{K\times K},\quad l\in\{1,2,3\},\quad \mathbf{A}^{(l)}\big|_{t=0}=\mathbf{0}
\end{equation}

The zero initialization ensures that the system begins with no assumptions about causal relationships and must learn these connections from data, promoting the discovery of genuine causal patterns rather than imposing predetermined structures.

Complementing the hierarchical structure, our temporal causal modeling component addresses the critical challenge of understanding how tactical decisions influence future combat states across different time delays. This is implemented through a set of temporal causal matrices $\mathbf{T}^{(\tau)} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K}$ that capture causal effects at specific time lags $\tau \in \{1, 2, ..., 5\}$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{T}^{(\tau)} \in \mathbb{R}^{K\times K},\quad \tau=1,\dots,5,\quad \mathbf{T}^{(\tau)}\big|_{t=0}=\mathbf{0}
\end{equation}

This temporal modeling is particularly crucial in aerial combat where the effects of maneuvers often manifest with significant delays due to the physics of flight dynamics and the strategic nature of combat positioning.

The integration of hierarchical and temporal causal information is achieved through a sophisticated attention-based mechanism that dynamically weights the contributions of different causal levels and temporal delays. The hierarchical levels are combined using learned attention weights that adapt based on the current combat context:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{level}}\in\Delta^{L-1},\quad \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{level}}\big|_{t=0}=\frac{1}{L}\mathbf{1}
\end{equation}

These weights are initialized uniformly but evolve during training to reflect the relative importance of different temporal scales for the current decision-making context.

The final causal-enhanced task representation synthesizes multi-level and temporal information through a comprehensive integration mechanism:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{t}_{\text{causal}} = \sum_{l=1}^{L} w_l \mathbf{A}^{(l)} \mathbf{t}_{\text{base}} + \sum_{\tau=1}^{5} \beta_\tau \mathbf{T}^{(\tau)} \mathbf{t}_{\text{history}}^{(\tau)}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{t}_{\text{base}}$ represents the base task prediction from the transformer backbone, and $\mathbf{t}_{\text{history}}^{(\tau)}$ captures historical task predictions at specific time lags. The temporal weights $\beta_\tau$ are learned parameters that determine the relative importance of different time delays in the current decision-making context.

The causal reasoning process is implemented through a sophisticated multi-layer neural network that processes the integrated causal information:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\mathrm{causal}}:\mathbb{R}^{2d}\to\mathbb{R}^{d},\quad
\mathbf{z}_{\mathrm{causal}} = \phi_{\mathrm{causal}}(\mathbf{x}),\; \mathbf{x}=[\mathbf{t}_{\mathrm{causal}};\mathbf{h}_i]
\end{equation}

This network architecture incorporates layer normalization and dropout for stable training, while the ReLU activation functions ensure that the causal reasoning process maintains interpretability through sparse activations.

To ensure that the learned causal structures remain interpretable and avoid overfitting to spurious correlations, we implement a comprehensive sparsity regularization scheme that encourages the discovery of parsimonious causal relationships:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}} = \lambda_{\text{sparse}} \sum_{l=1}^{L} ||\mathbf{A}^{(l)}||_1 + \lambda_{\text{temporal}} \sum_{\tau=1}^{5} ||\mathbf{T}^{(\tau)}||_1
\end{equation}

The regularization weights $\lambda_{\text{sparse}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{temporal}}$ are dynamically adjusted during training, starting with high values to encourage sparse structures and gradually decreasing to allow for the discovery of more complex causal relationships as the model's understanding of the domain improves. This adaptive regularization strategy ensures that the system develops interpretable causal models while maintaining the flexibility to capture the full complexity of aerial combat dynamics.

\subsection{Enhanced Counterfactual Decision Module}

The counterfactual decision module represents the cognitive core of our framework, implementing sophisticated reasoning mechanisms that enable UAV systems to evaluate alternative tactical decisions and their potential outcomes in complex aerial combat scenarios. This module transcends traditional reactive decision-making by incorporating uncertainty quantification, diversity-driven exploration, and interpretable explanation generation to ensure robust and transparent tactical reasoning under the inherent uncertainties of combat environments.

The architectural foundation of our CounterfactualDecisionMaker is built upon a modular design that seamlessly integrates multiple specialized components, each contributing essential capabilities to the overall decision-making process. The causal graph integration component serves as the foundational reasoning layer, incorporating the sophisticated CausalGraph network to provide causal-aware contextual understanding that informs all subsequent decision processes. This integration ensures that counterfactual reasoning is grounded in a deep understanding of the causal relationships that govern aerial combat dynamics.

The state projection layer functions as a critical interface between the high-dimensional hidden representations from the transformer backbone and the task-specific decision space. This component maps complex internal states to interpretable task representations, enabling the system to reason about tactical decisions in terms of the fundamental combat maneuvers: climb, dive, turn, and track. The projection mechanism is designed to preserve the essential information needed for tactical reasoning while reducing computational complexity and improving interpretability.

At the heart of the counterfactual evaluation process lies a sophisticated multi-layer neural network that processes concatenated features from the current state, alternative actions, and causal context to generate comprehensive assessments of potential tactical outcomes. This evaluation network is implemented as a deep sequential architecture that progressively refines its understanding of counterfactual scenarios:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\mathrm{cf}}:\mathbb{R}^{m}\to\mathbb{R}^{K},\quad \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{cf}}=\phi_{\mathrm{cf}}(\mathbf{u}),\; \mathbf{u}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}
\end{equation}

where $K=4$ represents the four fundamental combat tasks. The network architecture incorporates layer normalization and dropout mechanisms to ensure stable training and robust generalization, while the ReLU activations maintain computational efficiency and interpretability through sparse representations.

The uncertainty estimation component addresses one of the most critical challenges in autonomous combat systems: quantifying the confidence and reliability of tactical decisions under uncertain conditions. Our implementation distinguishes between two fundamental types of uncertainty that are crucial for robust decision-making in aerial combat scenarios. Epistemic uncertainty captures the model's confidence in its own predictions, reflecting the limitations of the training data and the inherent complexity of the decision-making task. Aleatoric uncertainty, on the other hand, quantifies the irreducible randomness and unpredictability inherent in the combat environment itself, including factors such as enemy behavior, weather conditions, and equipment reliability.

The uncertainty estimation network processes the concatenated state projection and hidden representation to generate a comprehensive confidence score that guides the decision-making process:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}:\mathcal{S}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\to[0,1],\quad \mathcal{U}(s,h)=u([s;h])
\end{equation}

where $s$ represents the state projection and $h$ denotes the hidden representation from the transformer backbone. The sigmoid activation ensures that uncertainty estimates are bounded between 0 and 1, providing intuitive confidence measures that can be easily interpreted by human operators and integrated into higher-level mission planning systems.

Building upon the uncertainty quantification capabilities, our adaptive decision process implements a dynamic intervention mechanism that adjusts the strength of counterfactual interventions based on the estimated uncertainty levels. This adaptive approach recognizes that high-uncertainty situations may require more conservative decision-making strategies, while low-uncertainty scenarios can accommodate more aggressive tactical maneuvers:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\text{intervention}} = \alpha_{\text{base}} \cdot (1 + \beta \cdot \mathcal{U}(s, h))
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_{\text{base}}$ represents the baseline intervention strength and $\beta$ controls the sensitivity of the adaptation mechanism to uncertainty estimates. This formulation ensures that the system becomes more cautious in its counterfactual reasoning when facing high uncertainty, while maintaining aggressive tactical capabilities when confidence is high.

To ensure comprehensive exploration of the tactical decision space and avoid the pitfalls of premature convergence to suboptimal strategies, our module incorporates a sophisticated diversity-driven exploration mechanism. This component balances the exploitation of known effective tactics with the exploration of potentially superior alternatives through learnable temperature and exploration parameters:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{temperature}\in\mathbb{R}_{>0},\quad \mathrm{temperature}\big|_{t=0}=1.0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{exploration\_factor}\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0},\quad \mathrm{exploration\_factor}\big|_{t=0}=0.1
\end{equation}

These parameters are not static but evolve dynamically during the training process, allowing the system to automatically adjust its exploration-exploitation balance based on the complexity of the tactical scenarios it encounters. The temperature parameter controls the sharpness of the decision distribution, with higher temperatures encouraging more diverse tactical choices, while the exploration factor directly influences the magnitude of exploratory deviations from the current best strategy.

Recognizing the critical importance of interpretability and explainability in autonomous combat systems, our framework incorporates a sophisticated explanation generation component that provides human-interpretable rationales for tactical decisions. This component analyzes the complex interplay of factors that influence decision-making and distills them into clear, actionable insights that can be understood by human operators and mission planners.

The explanation generator processes comprehensive contextual information including the current state, alternative actions, and causal relationships to generate detailed explanations that highlight both positive and negative influence factors:
\begin{equation}
\text{ExplanationGenerator} = \text{Sequential}(
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Linear}(3 \cdot \text{hidden\_size}, 2 \cdot \text{hidden\_size}), \text{ReLU}(), \\
&\text{Linear}(2 \cdot \text{hidden\_size}, \text{hidden\_size}), \text{ReLU}(), \\
&\text{Linear}(\text{hidden\_size}, 2K)
\end{aligned}
)
\end{equation}

The output of this network represents positive and negative influence factors for each of the $K$ combat tasks, enabling detailed analysis of why certain tactical decisions are favored or discouraged in specific combat scenarios. This interpretability is crucial for building trust in autonomous systems, enabling effective human-machine collaboration, and facilitating continuous improvement of tactical strategies through human feedback and domain expertise integration.

\subsection{Adaptive Causal Discovery Algorithm}

Our adaptive causal discovery algorithm represents a sophisticated approach to continuously learning and updating causal structures as new data becomes available during UAV operations. This algorithm addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining accurate causal models in dynamic environments where the underlying relationships between tactical decisions and their outcomes may evolve due to changing combat conditions, enemy adaptations, or environmental factors.

The foundation of our approach lies in the integration of multiple complementary causal discovery methods, each bringing unique strengths to the overall structure learning process. This multi-algorithm fusion strategy recognizes that no single causal discovery method is universally superior across all scenarios and conditions. Instead, by combining different approaches, we can leverage their complementary strengths while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

Our implementation combines three fundamentally different causal discovery paradigms to achieve comprehensive structure learning. Constraint-based methods, exemplified by the PC algorithm, identify causal relationships through systematic conditional independence tests, providing strong theoretical foundations and interpretable results. These methods excel at discovering the overall structure of causal networks but may struggle with finite sample effects and complex conditional dependencies.

Score-based methods, particularly the NOTEARS algorithm, approach causal discovery as a continuous optimization problem by optimizing a continuous relaxation of the acyclicity constraint. This approach is particularly effective at handling complex nonlinear relationships and can efficiently scale to larger networks, making it well-suited for the high-dimensional state spaces encountered in aerial combat scenarios.

Granger causality methods focus specifically on capturing temporal causal relationships in time series data, which is crucial for understanding how tactical decisions influence future combat states. These methods are particularly valuable for identifying time-delayed causal effects that are common in aerial combat, where the consequences of maneuvers often manifest with significant temporal delays.

The fusion mechanism dynamically weights each algorithm's contribution based on their historical performance in the current operational context:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}_{\text{fused}} = \sum_{k=1}^{3} w_k \mathbf{A}_k, \quad \text{where} \quad w_k = \frac{\exp(\eta_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{3} \exp(\eta_j)}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_k$ represents the performance score of algorithm $k$, continuously updated using exponential moving averages that reflect recent accuracy and reliability metrics. This adaptive weighting ensures that the most reliable methods have greater influence on the final causal structure while maintaining the ability to adapt to changing conditions.

The dynamic structure update mechanism implements an incremental learning approach that balances stability with adaptability. Rather than completely relearning causal structures from scratch when new data arrives, our system employs a sliding window approach that smoothly integrates new discoveries:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}_{t+1} = (1-\gamma) \mathbf{A}_t + \gamma \mathbf{A}_{\text{new}}
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ represents an adaptive update rate that automatically adjusts based on the stability and consistency of recent causal discoveries. When the causal structure appears stable, the update rate decreases to preserve established relationships. Conversely, when significant changes are detected in the underlying causal patterns, the update rate increases to enable rapid adaptation to new conditions.

For capturing the complex temporal dependencies that characterize aerial combat scenarios, our temporal causal discovery component extends the traditional causal discovery process to explicitly consider multiple time lags and delayed effects:
\begin{equation}
\text{Causality}(X_i \rightarrow X_j, \tau) = \max_{\tau \in [1, T_{\max}]} \text{GrangerTest}(X_i^{t-\tau}, X_j^t)
\end{equation}

This formulation enables the system to identify not only whether causal relationships exist between variables, but also the specific time delays at which these relationships are strongest, providing crucial information for tactical planning and decision-making.

\subsection{Multi-Stage Training Strategy}

Our training methodology is implemented through the CausalSequenceTrainer, which orchestrates a sophisticated multi-stage training process designed to progressively develop causal understanding and decision-making capabilities in UAV aerial combat scenarios. This comprehensive training framework recognizes that effective causal learning requires a structured approach that gradually builds complexity and understanding through carefully designed phases.

The CausalSequenceTrainer implements an adaptive training system that operates through three distinct phases, each designed to address specific aspects of causal learning and decision-making development. The exploration phase focuses on diverse trajectory sampling and fundamental causal structure discovery, encouraging the system to explore a wide range of tactical scenarios and begin identifying basic causal relationships between actions and outcomes. This phase emphasizes breadth over depth, ensuring that the system develops a comprehensive understanding of the tactical decision space before attempting to optimize specific strategies.

The refinement phase represents a critical transition where the system begins to balance causal discovery with targeted trajectory optimization. During this phase, the training process becomes more selective, focusing on promising tactical patterns while continuing to refine the underlying causal models. This balanced approach ensures that the system develops both accurate causal understanding and effective tactical capabilities simultaneously.

The exploitation phase emphasizes the utilization of high-reward trajectories and the stabilization of causal structures that have proven effective during the earlier phases. This final phase focuses on consolidating the learned causal relationships and optimizing performance based on the established understanding of tactical cause-and-effect relationships.

The training parameters are dynamically adjusted throughout these phases to support the specific learning objectives of each stage. During the exploration phase, the system employs enhanced diversity and structure learning parameters, with increased sparsity weight to encourage the discovery of fundamental causal relationships, reduced consistency weight to allow for exploratory variations, and extended intervention steps to enable comprehensive exploration of counterfactual scenarios:
\begin{align}
\text{sparsity\_weight} &= \text{base\_sparsity\_weight} \times 2.0 \\
\text{consistency\_weight} &= \text{base\_consistency\_weight} \times 0.5 \\
\text{intervention\_steps} &= \max(\text{base\_intervention\_steps}, 7)
\end{align}

The refinement phase employs balanced optimization parameters that maintain the baseline configuration, providing a stable foundation for the integration of exploration insights with targeted optimization:
\begin{align}
\text{sparsity\_weight} &= \text{base\_sparsity\_weight} \\
\text{consistency\_weight} &= \text{base\_consistency\_weight} \\
\text{intervention\_steps} &= \text{base\_intervention\_steps}
\end{align}

The exploitation phase focuses on structure stabilization and performance optimization through reduced sparsity weight to allow for more complex causal relationships, increased consistency weight to ensure stable and reliable causal reasoning, and reduced intervention steps to focus on the most effective counterfactual scenarios:
\begin{align}
\text{sparsity\_weight} &= \text{base\_sparsity\_weight} \times 0.5 \\
\text{consistency\_weight} &= \text{base\_consistency\_weight} \times 2.0 \\
\text{intervention\_steps} &= \max(3, \text{base\_intervention\_steps} - 2)
\end{align}

The causal training integration component supports multiple causal discovery methods including the PC algorithm for constraint-based discovery, Granger causality for temporal relationship identification, and score-based methods for continuous optimization approaches. This multi-method integration ensures robust causal structure learning across different types of relationships and data characteristics.

The training process incorporates comprehensive task transition statistics that maintain detailed counts of transitions between different combat tasks, enabling the system to learn the sequential patterns and dependencies that characterize effective tactical sequences:
\begin{equation}
\text{task\_transition\_counts} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K}
\end{equation}

Outcome-based learning mechanisms track detailed success and failure statistics for each combat task, providing essential feedback for adaptive learning and strategy refinement:
\begin{equation}
\text{task\_outcome\_counts}[i] = \{\text{success}: n_s^{(i)}, \text{failure}: n_f^{(i)}\}
\end{equation}

The batch weighting strategy ensures that high-reward trajectories receive increased attention during causal learning, implementing a temperature-scaled exponential weighting scheme that emphasizes successful tactical patterns:
\begin{equation}
w_i = \frac{\exp(\bar{r}_i \cdot \tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\bar{r}_j \cdot \tau)}
\end{equation}

where $\bar{r}_i$ represents the average reward of trajectory $i$ and $\tau = 0.1$ serves as the temperature parameter that controls the sharpness of the weighting distribution.

The multi-stage loss functions are carefully designed to optimize different objectives at each stage of the training process. The structure learning stage focuses on fundamental causal relationship discovery through a combination of task prediction accuracy, sparsity regularization, and consistency constraints:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{stage1}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_{\text{sparsity}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}} + \lambda_{\text{consistency}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}}
\end{equation}

The counterfactual training stage emphasizes the development of robust counterfactual reasoning capabilities through prediction accuracy, counterfactual generation quality, uncertainty quantification, and diversity promotion:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{stage2}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{prediction}} + \lambda_{\text{cf}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{counterfactual}} + \lambda_{\text{uncertainty}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{uncertainty}} + \lambda_{\text{diversity}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{diversity}}
\end{equation}

The joint fine-tuning stage integrates all components for comprehensive optimization, combining action prediction accuracy with causal reasoning quality, consistency maintenance, and uncertainty calibration:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{stage3}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{action}} + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{\text{calibration}}
\end{equation}

The adaptive phase transition mechanism automatically determines when to progress between training phases based on comprehensive performance metrics. The transition from exploration to refinement occurs when the system achieves sufficient task accuracy (greater than 0.7) after adequate exploration (100+ steps), indicating that basic causal relationships have been established. The transition from refinement to exploitation requires both high task accuracy (greater than 0.85) and sufficient counterfactual diversity (greater than 0.3) after extended training (200+ steps), ensuring that the system has developed both accurate and diverse tactical capabilities before focusing on optimization.

The training framework incorporates sophisticated learning rate scheduling with ReduceLROnPlateau mechanisms and early stopping criteria to ensure optimal convergence across all training stages while preventing overfitting and ensuring robust generalization to new tactical scenarios.

\section{Overview of Causal Inference Innovations}

This research introduces a series of causal inference innovations within the decision transformer framework, constructing a multi-level causal structure learning and counterfactual reasoning system. Our innovations are primarily manifested in four core aspects: multi-level causal graph networks, enhanced counterfactual decision modules, adaptive causal discovery algorithms, and uncertainty-guided causal learning.

\section{Multi-Level Causal Graph Networks}

\subsection{Hierarchical Causal Structure Modeling}

We design a multi-level causal graph network capable of capturing causal relationships at different abstraction levels. The framework consists of $L$ layers, where each layer $\mathcal{G}^{(l)}$ is represented by a causal adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$.

The causal adjacency matrix is computed as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}^{(l)}_{ij} = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\text{causal}} \cdot [\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}; \mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}] + \mathbf{b}^{(l)}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}$ is the hidden representation of task $i$ in layer $l$, and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function.

\subsection{Causal Relationship Propagation}

Inter-layer causal relationships are established through a propagation mechanism that combines local representations with causal influences from other tasks. This allows the network to learn hierarchical causal dependencies across different abstraction levels.

\subsection{Sparsity Regularization}

To learn interpretable causal structures, we apply L1 and L2 regularization to the adjacency matrices, encouraging sparse connections that represent the most significant causal relationships.

\section{Enhanced Counterfactual Decision Module}

\subsection{Uncertainty-Aware Counterfactual Reasoning}

Our counterfactual decision module integrates uncertainty estimation to quantify decision confidence. The module uses Bayesian neural networks to estimate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, providing a measure of how confident the model is in its counterfactual predictions.

The uncertainty estimation is formulated as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathcal{D})}[\text{Var}[f_\theta(s, a)]]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Diversity-Driven Generation}

The counterfactual generation process considers diversity constraints to ensure that generated samples cover a wide range of possible scenarios. This helps improve the robustness of the learned policy by exposing it to diverse counterfactual situations.

\subsection{Adaptive Intervention}

Intervention strength is dynamically adjusted based on the estimated uncertainty, allowing the model to make more conservative interventions in high-uncertainty regions and more aggressive interventions where confidence is high.

\section{Adaptive Causal Discovery Algorithm}

\subsection{Multi-Algorithm Fusion}

We integrate multiple causal discovery algorithms including PC algorithm, Granger causality test, and score-based methods. The fusion approach combines the strengths of different algorithms to achieve more robust causal structure learning.

\subsection{Temporal Causal Effects}

The framework considers time-delayed causal effects, which is particularly important for sequential decision-making tasks where actions may have delayed consequences.

\subsection{Dynamic Structure Updates}

Causal structures are dynamically updated as new data becomes available, allowing the model to adapt to changing environments and improve its causal understanding over time.

\section{Uncertainty-Guided Causal Learning}

\subsection{Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty}

We distinguish between epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) and aleatoric uncertainty (data uncertainty). This separation allows for more targeted learning strategies:

- **Epistemic uncertainty** indicates areas where the model lacks knowledge and would benefit from more training data
- **Aleatoric uncertainty** represents inherent randomness in the environment

\subsection{Uncertainty-Guided Sampling}

High uncertainty regions receive higher sampling weights during training, ensuring that the model focuses on learning in areas where it is least confident.

\subsection{Calibration}

We ensure that uncertainty estimates are well-calibrated, meaning that the predicted confidence levels accurately reflect the actual prediction accuracy.

\section{Multi-Stage Training Strategy}

Our training approach consists of three main stages:

\subsection{Structure Learning Stage}
Focus on learning stable causal structures with sparsity and consistency constraints.

\subsection{Counterfactual Training Stage}
Train the counterfactual reasoning module on the learned causal structures, emphasizing diversity and uncertainty quantification.

\subsection{Joint Fine-tuning Stage}
Jointly optimize all components with a combined loss function that balances task performance, causal consistency, and uncertainty calibration.

The total loss function is:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{action}} + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{\text{calibration}}
\end{equation}

\section{Algorithm Complexity}

The computational complexity of our approach scales as $\mathcal{O}(L \cdot n^2 \cdot d + K \cdot n \cdot d)$, where $L$ is the number of layers, $n$ is the number of tasks, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $K$ is the number of counterfactual samples. This complexity is manageable for practical applications while providing significant performance improvements.
